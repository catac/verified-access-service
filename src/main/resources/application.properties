# here we say that we want to enable accesslog
server.tomcat.accesslog.enabled=true

# it is important to understand what the options means:
# 'directory/prefix + suffix + file-date-format' will be
# the file that tomcat will try to open.
# /dev/stdout is standard output, so we want tomcat
# to write to that fd. Then, we need to play with
# directory, prefix, suffix and file-date-format to match our desired path.
